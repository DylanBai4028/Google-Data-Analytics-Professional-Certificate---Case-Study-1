### Case Study 1: How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

## Introduction
Founded in 2016, Cyclistic has established itself as a prominent bike-share company in Chicago, operating a sizeable fleet of 5,824 bicycles across a network of 692 geotracked stations. The company’s pricing model, offering single-ride passes, full-day passes, and annual memberships, has attracted both **casual riders** (those who purchase single-ride or full-day passes) and dedicated **Cyclistic members** (those who purchase annual memberships), with the latter proving to be significantly more profitable, as indicated by the company’s financial analysts. Lily Moreno, the Director of Marketing aims to bolster future growth by converting casual riders into annual members, prompting a focused analysis by the marketing analyst team into the differing behaviours of these two customer segments. This investigation also seeks to uncover the motivations behind purchasing memberships and explore the potential influence of digital media on Cyclistic’s marketing tactics, utilising a comprehensive examination of the company’s historical bike trip data to inform strategic decision-making.

## Background
As a junior data analyst within Cyclistic’s marketing analyst team, my primary objective is to investigate the distinctions in the usage patterns of casual riders and annual members, with the overarching aim of devising a new marketing strategy focused on the conversion of casual riders into loyal annual members. Guided by the director of marketing, Lily Moreno, my role involves delving into the intricacies of how these two customer segments utilise Cyclistic bikes differently, identifying the motivations behind casual riders opting for annual memberships, and exploring the potential impact of digital media on marketing tactics. In order to accomplish this, my task at hand requires me to analyse the Cyclistic historical bike trip data to identify trends.

## Data Analysis Process
In this case study, the six steps of the data analysis process will be used in order to solve our problem. These 6 steps include:

1. Ask
2. Prepare
3. Process
4. Analyse
5. Share
6. Act
  
### Step 1: Ask
#### 1.1 Identify the Business Task:
Design marketing strategies aimed at converting casual riders into annual members.

#### 1.2 Consider the Key Stakeholders:
* *Lily Moreno*: The director of marketing and your manager. Moreno is responsible for the development of campaigns and initiatives to promote the bike-share program.
* *Cyclistic Marketing Analytics Team*: A team of data analysts who are responsible for collecting, analysing, and reporting data that helps guide Cyclistic marketing strategy.
* *Cyclistic Executive Team*: The notoriously detail-oriented executive team will decide whether to approve the recommended marketing program. 

#### 1.3 Questions to Analyse:
1. *How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?*
2. *Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?*
3. *How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?*

Moreno has assigned to me the first question to answer as part of this project: How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

### Step 2: Prepare
This stage of the data analysis process will entail examining the selected data source to be utilised in the analysis. This examination will involve assessing the data's organisation, evaluating its credibility, determining the level of data security, and understanding its overall structure.

#### 2.1 Data Source
The selected data source for the analysis encompasses Cyclistic's historical trip data spanning from January 2022 to December 2022. These datasets were acquired in the form of 12 zipped files, with the data being accessible and licensed by Motivate International Inc. Access to the datasets can be found by following the [provided link](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html). 

#### 2.2 Data Credibility
The datasets, collected by Lyft Bikes and Scooters, LLC ("Bikeshare") from the City of Chicago's Divvy bicycle sharing service, are made available to the public under specific terms and conditions of the License Agreement. Our analysis qualifies as a "lawful purpose," permitting our use of the datasets. The involvement of Lyft Bikes and the City of Chicago in data ownership contributes to the credibility of the datasets. However, the Agreement grants Bikeshare the authority to modify or terminate data provision without cause, warranting cautious consideration. Despite this, we can reasonably consider the datasets credible for our analysis.

#### 2.3 Data Security & Limitations
Rider's personally identifiable information remains concealed in adherence to data privacy regulations, ensuring the exclusion of any personal data and credit card information from the datasets. Original dataset files are securely backed up in a separate folder to preserve the integrity of the initial data prior to processing and cleaning. However, due to the anonymisation of personally identifiable information, certain limitations arise, such as the inability to link pass purchases to credit card numbers for insights into rider location within the Cyclistic service area and the frequency of single pass purchases.

#### 2.4 Data Information and Structure
The data source includes 12 csv files labelled as *"YYYYMM-divvy-tripdata"*, each representing data for a particular month. Each file comprises 13 columns containing specific ride-related information, with the following corresponding column names:

* ride_id
* rideable_type
* started_at
* ended_at
* start_station_name
* start_station_id
* end_station_name
* end_station_id
* start_lat
* start_lng
* end_lat
* end_lng
* member_casual

### Step 3: Process
This phase of the data analysis process includes eliminating errors, inaccuracies, and inconsistencies that might impact the analysis's validity. Additionally, I will modify the columns as necessary to optimise the data format for the analysis.

#### 3.1 Tools To be Used
I’ve opted to use the R programming language for its capacity to handle large data volumes and its diverse range of functions suitable for data cleaning tasks. While Excel was initially considered, its limitations in processing the consolidation of 12 months of bicycle data made it unsuitable. While acknowledging the advantages of SQL, I chose to prioritise enhancing my R skills, given the added flexibility provided by the language's extensive functions despite its relatively higher complexity.

#### 3.2 Data Combination

Prior to processing and cleaning, the following libraries were loaded in RStudio to equip the system with the essential tools for the required operations. The code is as follows:

```{r Load Libriaries}
library(tidyverse) #for calculations
library(dplyr) #for managing data frames
library(lubridate) #for manipulation of dates
library(hms) #for manipulation of time
library(readr) #for uploading .csv files into R
```

The 12 monthly tripdata CSV files were uploaded into R Studio for manipulation to form a comprehensive 2022 bicycle dataset. The code is as follows:

```{r Create Data Frames for Monthly Datasets}
jan22_df <- read_csv("202201-divvy-tripdata.csv")
feb22_df <- read_csv("202202-divvy-tripdata.csv")
mar22_df <- read_csv("202203-divvy-tripdata.csv")
apr22_df <- read_csv("202204-divvy-tripdata.csv")
may22_df <- read_csv("202205-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jun22_df <- read_csv("202206-divvy-tripdata.csv")
jul22_df <- read_csv("202207-divvy-tripdata.csv")
aug22_df <- read_csv("202208-divvy-tripdata.csv")
sep22_df <- read_csv("202209-divvy-tripdata.csv")
oct22_df <- read_csv("202210-divvy-tripdata.csv")
nov22_df <- read_csv("202211-divvy-tripdata.csv")
dec22_df <- read_csv("202212-divvy-tripdata.csv")
```

Next, we need to make sure that all our data frames have consistent variables. The dates in the `jan22_df` are represented as characters, therefore we need to convert them into dates with the following code:

```{r Convert jan_df dates into a timestamp}
jan22_df <- jan22_df %>%  mutate(ended_at = as_datetime(ended_at, format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M"), 
                                   started_at = as_datetime(started_at, format = "%d/%m/%Y %H:%M"))
```


The following syntax combines all 12 files into a single dataset, creating a new data frame named `trip22_df` with the provided code:

```{r Combine Monthly Data Frames}
trip22_df <- rbind(jan22_df, feb22_df, mar22_df, apr22_df, may22_df, jun22_df, jul22_df, aug22_df, sep22_df, 
                   oct22_df, nov22_df, dec22_df)
```

#### 3.3 Data Exploration
To check our combined dataset we will use the `str` function to gain a preview of our data:

```{r Preview Newly Combined Data Frame}
str(trip22_df)
```

From this, we can see that our bicycle data for the year 2022 has been combined and that there are 5,667,717 rows/observations within our newly combined data frame. 

With the combination of our monthly datasets into a single data frame, the individual monthly data frames are no longer necessary, prompting their removal to reduce memory usage in R.

```{r Remove monthly data frames}
rm(jan22_df, feb22_df, mar22_df, apr22_df, may22_df, jun22_df, jul22_df, aug22_df, sep22_df, oct22_df, nov22_df,
   dec22_df)
```

#### 3.4 Additional Data Columns
To prepare for analysis, additional columns are added to the data frame, offering further insights to answer the overarching business question of the distinct usage patterns of annual members and casual riders. The new columns include:

* ride_length – duration of each ride
* day_of_week – day of the week that each ride started
* time – time that each ride started (converted to HH:MM:SS format)
* month – month that each ride started
* season – the season that each ride began (Spring, Summer, Winter and Autumn)
* hour – hour of which each ride started
* time_of_day – part of the day that each ride started (Morning: 5am-12pm, Afternoon: 12-5pm, Evening: 5-9pm and Night: 9pm–4am)

```{r Adding columns}
#Calculate ride length and place in new column
ride_length <- difftime(trip22_df$ended_at, trip22_df$started_at, units = "min")
trip22_df$ride_length <- as.numeric(ride_length) #convert column values as numeric
remove(ride_length) #remove unnecessary data frame

#Calculate day of the week and place in new column
trip22_df$day_of_week <- weekdays(trip22_df$started_at)

#Calculate time that each ride started
trip22_df$time <- format(trip22_df$started_at, format = "%H:%M:%S")

#Calculate month that each ride started
trip22_df$month <- format(trip22_df$started_at, format = "%B")

#Determine the season that each ride started
seasons <- function(x){
  if(x %in% 3:5){ 
    return("Spring")
  }
  if(x %in% 6:8){ 
    return("Summer")
  }
  if(x %in% 9:11){ 
    return("Autumn")
  }
  if(x %in% c(12,1,2)){ 
    return("Winter")
  }
} #create a function that determines the season based on month
trip22_df$date <- as.Date(trip22_df$started_at, format = "%Y/%m/%d") #create new column for the date
trip22_df$season <- sapply(month(trip22_df$date), seasons)
trip22_df <- select(trip22_df, -date) #remove date column

#Create separate column for hour that each ride started
trip22_df$hour <- hour(trip22_df$started_at)

#Determine the time of day that each ride started
timeofday <- function(x){
  if(x %in% 5:11){
    return("Morning")
  }
  if(x %in% 12:16){
    return("Afternoon")
  }
  if(x %in% 17:20){
    return("Evening")
  }
  if(x %in% c(21:24,0:4)){
    return("Night")
  }
} #create a function that determines the time of day based on hour of the day
trip22_df$time_of_day <- sapply(trip22_df$hour, timeofday)
```
#### 3.5 Data Cleaning
At this stage, we will clean our data of any duplicate rows, any rows containing NA values (blank rows) and any rows where `ride_length` is 0 or negative, using the following code:

```{r Clean the data}
trip22_df <- trip22_df %>% distinct() #remove duplicate rows
trip22_df <- drop_na(trip22_df) #remove empty rows and NA values
trip22_df <- trip22_df[trip22_df$ride_length > 0, ] #remove negative and zero values
```

After cleaning and manipulating the `trip22_df` data frame, we have 4,368,438 rows and 20 columns.

### Step 4: Analyse
We will use R to conduct an initial analysis of our cleaned data frame to identify any trends, patterns or unusual aspects relating to the customer behaviour of our casual riders and Cyclistic members. Our analysis involved determining the following information:

* Calculating total average ride length
* Average ride length for each member type
* Number of casual riders vs Cyclistic members
* Number of riders for each bike type, grouped by member type
* Average ride length for each bike type, separated by member type
* Average ride length for each hour in a day, time classification of the day, day of the week, month, and season, separated by member type
* Total rides for each hour, time of classification of the day, day of the week, month and season, separated by member type
* Most popular starting stations, separated by member type

The above analysis is demonstrated through the following code:

```{r Analysis of data frame}
#Calculate total average ride length
total_average_ride_length <- mean(trip22_df$ride_length)
print(total_average_ride_length)

#Calculate average ride length for each member type
average_ride_length_membertype <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% summarise(average_ride_length = 
                                                                                        mean(ride_length))
print(average_ride_length_membertype)

#Determine number of casual riders vs Cyclistic members
number_of_rider_groupings <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual) %>% count(member_casual)
colnames(number_of_rider_groupings)[2] <- "number_of_riders"
print(number_of_rider_groupings)

#Determine number of riders for each bike type, separated by member type
bike_type_riders <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual,rideable_type) %>% count(member_casual)
colnames(bike_type_riders)[3] <- "number_of_riders"
print(bike_type_riders)

#Calculate average ride length for each bike type, separated by member type
bike_type_average_ride <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual,rideable_type) %>% summarise(average_ride_length =
                                                                                              mean(ride_length))
print(bike_type_average_ride)

#Calculate average ride length for various categories of time
average_ride_length_by_hour <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, hour) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
average_ride_length_by_timeofday <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, time_of_day) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
average_ride_length_by_dayofweek <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
average_ride_length_by_month <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, month) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length))
average_ride_length_by_season <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, season) %>% 
  summarise(average_ride_length = mean(ride_length))

print(average_ride_length_by_hour)
print(average_ride_length_by_timeofday)
print(average_ride_length_by_dayofweek)
print(average_ride_length_by_month)
print(average_ride_length_by_season)

#Calculate total rides for various categories of time
number_of_rides_hour <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, hour) %>% count(member_casual)
number_of_rides_timeofday <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, time_of_day) %>% count(member_casual)
number_of_rides_dayofweek <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, day_of_week) %>% count(member_casual)
number_of_rides_month <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual, month) %>% count(member_casual)
number_of_rides_season <- trip22_df %>% group_by(member_casual,season) %>% count(member_casual)

colnames(number_of_rides_hour)[3] <- "number_of_riders"
colnames(number_of_rides_timeofday)[3] <- "number_of_riders"
colnames(number_of_rides_dayofweek)[3] <- "number_of_riders"
colnames(number_of_rides_month)[3] <- "number_of_riders"
colnames(number_of_rides_season)[3] <- "number_of_riders"

print(number_of_rides_hour)
print(number_of_rides_timeofday)
print(number_of_rides_dayofweek)
print(number_of_rides_month)
print(number_of_rides_season)

#Calculate most popular starting station, separated by member type
popular_starting_station_casual <- trip22_df %>% group_by(start_station_name) %>% 
  filter(member_casual == "casual") %>% 
  count(start_station_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
colnames(popular_starting_station_casual)[2] <- "number_of_rides"

popular_starting_station_member <- trip22_df %>% group_by(start_station_name) %>% 
  filter(member_casual == "member") %>% 
  count(start_station_name) %>% 
  arrange(desc(n))
colnames(popular_starting_station_member)[2] <- "number_of_rides"

print(popular_starting_station_casual)
print(popular_starting_station_member)
```

### Step 5: Share
To enhance the comprehensibility of our analysis for stakeholders and a broader audience, we will employ Tableau to create clear and engaging data visualisations. The code snippet below demonstrates the extraction of our processed data as a CSV file for integration into the Tableau interface:

```{r Extract data as a csv file}
#Create new data frame to export for use in Tableau
trip22_df_tableau <- trip22_df

#Clean the data of columns that will not be used
trip22_df_tableau <- trip22_df_tableau %>% select(-c(ride_id, start_station_id, end_station_id, 
                                                     end_station_name, started_at, ended_at, time))

#Export data as a csv file
write.csv(trip22_df_tableau, file = "cyclistic_2022_tableau.csv", row.names = FALSE)
```

#### 5.1 Tableau Dashboard
To effectively communicate our analysis findings, I will export the cleaned dataset to Tableau, creating a user-friendly dashboard that highlights trends and patterns in casual and member rider behaviour. The public [dashboard link](https://public.tableau.com/views/GoogleCapstoneProjectCaseStudy1FinalVersion/TableauDashboard?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link) directs audiences to my interactive data visualisation dashboard on Tableau, enabling stakeholders to easily interpret the insights. A screenshot of the dashboard is also provided below for quick reference.

![](Images/Tableau_Dashboard.png)

### Step 6: Act
In the final stage of the data analysis process, we will summarise our key findings and present to our stakeholders our recommendations based on our data analysis and visualisations.

#### 6.1 Key Findings
Members had the most rides at 59.76% of total rides. The average ride length was fairly consistent throughout the week and year. On the other hand, Casual riders had greater fluctuations in average ride lengths, with peaks occurring on Saturdays and during the season of Summer. Overall, casual riders nearly doubled the average ride length of members.

The most popular bike type across both members and casual riders was the Classic Bike, which accounted for nearly 60% of total rides. Interestingly, only Casual riders used the Docked Bike, which only accounted for 4% of total rides. Despite this, docked bikes had an average ride length of 50.71 minutes per ride, which more than doubled the total average ride length.

Both members and casual riders rode in the afternoons (12-5pm) most frequently. 5-6pm was the busiest hour and 4am saw the least amount of usage for Cyclistic bikes.
Summer (June-August) was the busiest season for both groups of riders, with July being the peak month. The winter months saw the least amount of bike usage.

Lastly, Streeter Dr & Grand Ave was the most popular starting station for all riders and for casual riders as well. Kingsbury St & Kinzie St was the most popular starting station for member riders. Starting station popularity also indicated that casual riders prefer riding along the waterfront while member riders prefer riding within the inner CBD area of Chicago.

#### 6.2 Recommendations
Upon analysing the data between the behaviours of casual and member riders, several strategic opportunities have emerged to drive the conversion of casual riders into Cyclistic members. The following recommendations are proposed:

1.	Launch marketing campaigns tailored for casual riders in the prelude to summer.
2.	Introduce weekday membership discounts while adjusting weekend single-ride and single-day pass prices to incentivise casual riders to opt for subscriptions.
3.	Concentrate marketing efforts along the coastal regions, where casual riders are predominantly located.
4.	Introduce a new membership tier for summer and/or weekend year-long memberships to boost the conversion rate of casual riders to Cyclistic members.
