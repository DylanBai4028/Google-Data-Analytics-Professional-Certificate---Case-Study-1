# Google-Data-Analytics-Professional-Certificate---Case-Study-1
This repository showcases my work for the Google Data Analytics Professional Certificate Course Capstone Project. Utilising R, I processed and analysed the provided open-source dataset from Cyclistic, a Chicago-based bike-sharing company. The findings were then translated into an interactive Tableau dashboard, delineating the disparities in the usage patterns between casual and member riders, culminating in marketing suggestions to convert casual riders into loyal Cyclistic members.

## Background
Established in 2016, Cyclistic is a leading bike-share company in Chicago, boasting an extensive fleet of 5,824 bicycles spanning 692 geotracked stations. Its pricing structure caters to both casual riders, purchasing single-ride or full-day passes, and committed Cyclistic members, yielding notably higher profitability, as evidenced by financial analyses. Under the leadership of Lily Moreno, the Director of Marketing, the company aims to fuel future growth by transitioning casual riders into long-term members, spurring an in-depth analysis by the marketing analyst team into the divergent behaviours of these distinct customer segments. This comprehensive investigation also delves into the underlying motivations behind membership purchases and explores the potential influence of digital media on Cyclistic’s marketing strategies, leveraging an examination of the company’s historical bike trip data to inform strategic decision-making. As a junior data analyst embedded within Cyclistic’s marketing analyst team, the business task is to determine usage disparities between casual riders and annual members, ultimately devising a targeted marketing strategy focused on converting casual riders into loyal annual members. The role necessitates an exploration of how these customer segments interact with Cyclistic bikes differently, unravelling the underlying motivations behind casual riders' subscription choices, and probing the potential impact of digital media on marketing tactics. To achieve these objectives, the data analysis process was applied to Cyclistic's historical bike trip data to identify pivotal trends and patterns, whereupon appropriate recommendations could be made.
